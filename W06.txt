https://pr0ve.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/jxxb/cse341-project-master

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
All the functionality meets all requirements to my understanding.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
I believe everything is complete with the error handling, authenication, and 500 and 404 pages.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I think the coolest thing was the concepts of routing and the MVP set up is starting to make a lot more sense now than it ever was before.  I am grateful for what I have learned generally from this project.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I would probably give an extra week on this assignment.  A stronger encouragement to watch the videos on x2 speed might have been helpful for me.  I thought I was doing the right thing by watching it regularly, but it was not a good idea for me.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
   I believe this project shows my personal creativity because I coded everything myself. I have done everything required of me and I believe I have excelled in this project by trying my best to learn all the concepts given to me.  Although it was really difficult, I am pulling through and I am progressing into a much better and more organized coder.
